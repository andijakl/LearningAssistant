# Voice Learning

Helps you learn and remember important concepts from your lectures / trainings.

Do you have difficulties learning for your exams - especially now with remote learning and even more time in front of your computer? Voice Learning helps you repeat the most important topics of your courses. Not by sitting in front of your computer or reading books, but just by talking.

The Voice Learning skill will ask you key questions and concepts, either as yes/no questions or multiple choice questions. After your answer, the skill will tell you if you were right. Voice Learning also keeps track of your progress and prioritizes questions you got wrong so that you can repeat them until you remember the right answer!

The skill was specifically developed for the University of Applied Sciences in St. Pölten, Austria. It contains questions for several of our courses. However, its code is completely open source - so it's easy for other universities or companies to adapt it to their own needs and feed in their own content!
